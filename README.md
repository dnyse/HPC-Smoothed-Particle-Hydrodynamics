# HPC Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

A learning-oriented implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for high-performance computing applications.

## About This Project

This repository represents my journey into understanding and implementing SPH methods for scientific computing as part of my computational science studies with a focus on high-performance computing. Coming from a computer science background with solid knowledge of numerical methods but limited physics experience, this project serves as both a learning exercise and an evolving implementation of SPH techniques optimized for HPC environments.

As a computational science student, this work bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, emphasizing the computational challenges and optimization opportunities that arise when applying SPH methods to real-world scientific problems at scale.

## Learning Philosophy

Rather than starting with a fully-featured SPH solver, this repository follows an incremental approach:

- **Foundation First**: Begin with basic SPH formulations to understand the underlying physics and mathematics
- **Implementation Focus**: Emphasize clean, readable C++ code that can be understood and modified
- **Performance Evolution**: Gradually introduce HPC optimizations (vectorization, parallelization, GPU acceleration)
- **Scientific Rigor**: Validate each implementation stage against established benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed explanations of both theory and implementation choices
